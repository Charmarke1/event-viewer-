# Monitoring Activities through Event Viewer

## Overview 
 This project demonstrates how to monitor user logins and system activities within a virtual lab environment set up in Azure. The focus of this project is to track successful and failed login attempts in a domain-based environment, using native Windows tools such as **Event Viewer** and **Group Policy Management**.

**This repository provides a step-by-step guide, screenshots, and example log files to help users**:

- Understand how to monitor login activities.
- Learn how to filter and export important event logs (like successful and failed logins).
- Set up Group Policy for auditing logon events across the network.

  **The tools use in this project**:
  - **Event Viewer** for accessing security logs.
  - **Group Policy Management** for configuring audit settings.
  - **Excel** for reviewing and analyzing exported logs.

By the end of this project, users will be able to monitor login activities, track potential security issues, and maintain a secure environment in their Azure lab or similar network.
